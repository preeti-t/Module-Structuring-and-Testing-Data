// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// 3 times

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// 0

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// 00

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// when pad function is called 3rd time pad(remainingSeconds) -> remainingSeconds = 1
// 1

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// when pad function is called 3rd time pad(remainingSeconds) -> remainingSeconds = 1, but after padding it becomes 01 and returns it
// 01
