Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?  It pops up a small alert tab mentioning `"Hello world!"`

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of "What is your name?" - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have? In this pop up tab I now see a prompt `" What is your name"` and under it an empty input space to add `my name`. 

What is the return value of `prompt`?  It is empty if I don't input my name.
